## Health & Wellness Services At the Comfort of Your Home 

`Beautify` is an appointment scheduling app that searches for services by category and allows users to book them. It also allows users to become a provider and add their own services that will be available for booking to other users.

This is a full-stack web-based application built upon the `Node.js` environment, heavily relying on `Express` for functionality utilizing `MySQL` database for populating our site's content as well as for storing user information. `Beautify` utilizes user authentication through `Passport`.

The application's user interface is built upon `React` and utilizes Stateless React Components within `Reactstrap` for creating elements of our application for continuous reuse, reducing the amount of hardcoding needed for all of the different pages and views within the application flow.
